# alexaFindMyPhone
an Alexa Skill that calls your phone to find it 

04/18/2019: 

Knowledge: 
- Learned what intents are and how they are handled by alexa
- Learned how to make api calls to alexa as well as other API's
- Learned about asynchronous response as well as how to call API to retrieve customer phone number 
- Learned that Twilio offers a way to call phone numbers programmatically 
- Created Twilio account and read about the method to call phone numbers 

Testing: 
- Invocation works
- Bug: "You've triggered the CallPhoneIntent" instead of the speechText in the CallPhoneIntent

To-Do List: 
- Fix bug so that CallPhoneIntent runs properly 
- Figure out how to implement Twilio (most likely using a lambda function separate from the alexa skill)
